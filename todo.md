# Important
- manage locations
- export data to downloadable CSV / filesystem
- show days with climbs logged
- hotseat mode -- log for your friend and have your friend log for you when you're on the wall
- share to facebook / twitter
- post-climb day statistics
    - ex: {{total wins}} and {{total losses}} in 4 hours
    - longest streak: {{ 7 wins }}
    - average grade: {{ weighted }}
    - dot graph, large size = more attempts, x = time, y = grade difficulty


# Ongoing
- uglify and package all resources into a single file
- set up cordova and build an android APK
- find a better logo... that's got a good license
- add transitions between screens
- add achievements

# Less important
- change grade system for today?
- add activies tangential to climbing
- remove calendar dependency
