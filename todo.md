# Important
- export data to downloadable CSV / filesystem
- longpress on climb entry to show win/loss counters and option to delete the climb
- post-climb day statistics
    - ex: {{total wins}} and {{total losses}} in 4 hours
    - longest streak: {{ 7 wins }}
    - average grade: {{ weighted }}
    - dot graph, large size = more attempts, x = time, y = grade difficulty


# Ongoing
- quickstart button on calendar page --> go straight to today and check in
- add help screen for a checked-in day
- uglify and package all resources into a single file
- set up cordova and build an android APK
- find a better logo... that's got a good license
- add transitions between screens
- add achievements

# Less important
- add activies tangential to climbing
