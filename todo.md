# Important
- add transitions between screens
- export data to downloadable CSV / filesystem
- stacked bar graphs of wins losses
- cut down empty grades post climb
- edit locations
- show days with climbs logged
- hotseat mode -- log for your friend and have your friend log for you when you're on the wall
- share to facebook / twitter
- post-climb day statistics
    - ex: {{total wins}} and {{total losses}} in 4 hours
    - longest streak: {{ 7 wins }}
    - average grade: {{ weighted }}
    - dot graph, large size = more attempts, x = time, y = grade difficulty

# Ongoing
